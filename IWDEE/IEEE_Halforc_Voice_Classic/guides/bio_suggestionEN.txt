BIO BGEE & BG2EE:
-----------------
Hur-Tok's arrival in the world mirrors the cruel fate of many half-orcs in Faerun. 
Before his first breath, his human mother was captured in a brutal raid. Enslaved, she was forced to bear a child. 
When a band of mercenaries infiltrated and destroyed the orc camp, her health was already failing.
They found her dead, but miraculously, the baby survived. Driven by greed, the mercenaries, rather than offering him sanctuary, callously planned to sell him into slavery.

However, no one desired a half-orc infant, leaving them with an unwelcome burden. 
So, with a warped sense of practicality, they trained him as a mercenary to fill their dwindling ranks.
Ironically, during his first mercenary assignment, Hur-Tok became the sole survivor when they were ambushed by orcs. 
This brutal twist of fate solidified his cynical outlook on life.

His orcish heritage manifests in moments of rage, blinding him to reason. However, his human side grants him more control than a full-blooded orc. 
He thrives on the thrill of the hunt, relishing the fear he inspires in his prey. 
However, he's not averse to utilizing magic when the situation calls for it. 
Hur-Tok understands the value of embracing both his human and orcish instincts.

After a failed attempt to join the Flaming Fist in Baldur's Gate, Hur-Tok heard whispers of opportunity in the harsh and unforgiving north. 
The rumors spoke of Icewind Dale, a dale where even a half-orc like him might carve out a place for himself. 
Fueled by a desire to forge a name and a yearning for belonging, Hur-Tok set out on a journey towards the icy expanse, hoping to find a semblance of home in this unforgiving land.
