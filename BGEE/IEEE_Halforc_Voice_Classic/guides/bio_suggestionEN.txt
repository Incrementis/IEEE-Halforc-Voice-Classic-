BIO BGEE & BG2EE:
-----------------
Hur-Tok's birth was a harsh reality, mirroring the fate of many other half-orcs in Faerun. Before his first breath, his human mother was captured in a brutal orc raid. Enslaved, she was forced to bear a child. When a band of adventurers infiltrated and destroyed the orc camp, her health was already failing.
They found her dead, but miraculously, the baby survived. Determined to offer him a safe life, the adventurers removed him from his mother's body.

They brought Hur-Tok to Candlekeep, where the monks nurtured him until he could decide his own path. During his youth, Hur-Tok formed a close friendship with [CHARNAME]. They were inseparable, facing challenges and playing pranks on the monks together.
This strong bond forged in their youth translates into unwavering support for one another. Hur-Tok identifies with [CHARNAME] completely, due to similar backstory, and will never leave [CHARNAME]'s side unless explicitly desired. He would follow [CHARNAME] "to the nine hells and back," as the saying goes.

His orcish heritage manifests in moments of rage, blinding him to reason. However, his human side grants him more control than a full-blooded orc. He thrives on the thrill of the hunt, relishing the fear he inspires in his prey. However, he's not averse to utilizing magic when the situation calls for it. Hur-Tok understands the value of embracing both his human and orcish instincts.

While orcs might perceive him as weak and soft, humans often view him as a brute. Hur-Tok believes he embodies the best of both worlds and yearns to prove it. Being with [CHARNAME] and the party provides him with the perfect opportunity to do so.

A faint memory remains from his childhood. One of the adventurer who saved him and brought him to Candlekeep visited occasionally. The one detail that stands out most is a beautiful pin depicting a bow with many strings. Although it didn't resemble a weapon, it left a lasting impression.

The subtle mistrust directed towards him has fostered a general suspicion of everyone, except for [CHARNAME]. [CHARNAME] represent a constant source of positivity in his life, and Hur-Tok is fiercely dedicated to [CHARNAME]'s protection.
