This mod was created using the [IEEE PCVI Pack](https://github.com/Incrementis/IEEE-Player-Character-Voice-Installer-Pack-) tool/template set.

## Supported Games

* BG:EE (Baldur's Gate:Enhanced Edition) tested version is 2.6.6.0
* SoD (Siege of Dragonspear) tested version is 2.6.6.0
* BG2:EE (Baldur's Gate 2:Enhanced Edition) tested version is 2.6.6.0
* IWD:EE (Icewind Dale:Enhanced Edition) tested version is 2.6.6.0

The SoD and BG2:EE versions can be installed in BG:EE and IWD:EE if desired, but I do not recommend it, as SoD and BG2:EE have lines that could affect consistency with other custom character voice sets.

BG:EE and IWD:EE versions cannot be installed in SoD or BG2:EE.
BG:EE can be installed in IWD:EE and SoD.
IWD:EE cannot be installed in BG:EE.


## Operating Systems

* Implemented and tested on Micrososft Windows 11
* It is highly possible that the mod will NOT work on other OS like Linux or MAC


## Compatibility

* It uses the unofficial [soundset convention](https://www.gibberlings3.net/forums/topic/34560-adding-soundsets-to-the-ees-using-the-ee-soundset-tool/) for advanced sound slots, ensuring compatibility with sound files developed under this standard.


## Languages

* English
* Deutsch

There are a maximum of 42 voice lines for each language, so there are 84 voice lines in total.
